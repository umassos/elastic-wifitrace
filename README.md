# About
WiFiTrace is a network-centric contact tracing method that uses enterprise WiFi networks for contact tracing in office and campus settings. Unlike bluetooth-based methods, it does not require an app to be installed on user phones and instead uses syslog data generated by enterprise WiFi access points to trace locations within office/campus buildings that an infected user has visited. It can also report other users who were seen for a period of time near those access points.

WiFiTrace is an open-source project led by Computer Science researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The project has a website at http://wifitrace.github.io/
